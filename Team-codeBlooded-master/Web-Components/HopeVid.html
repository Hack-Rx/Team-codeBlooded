        <h1 class="title">Background üìñ</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          As of 12th June, we have 298,283 Cases of COVID-19 reported in India,
          out of which 8,855 innocent people have lost their lives. Right now,
          as much as we require Healthcare Professionals giving their level best
          trying to save lives, we also require major technological advancements
          in the healthcare domain to overcome this situation caused by the
          Global Pandemic. Tracking probable suspects and Escalating
          investigation at this point of time seems to be the only way we can
          possibly flatten the curve and raise the line, by stopping further
          spread of Novel Coronavirus and helping those already affected recover
          at the earliest so we don't face more casualties. The Novel
          Coronavirus has four stages of transmission:
        </p>

        <div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li><p>Stage 1:First Appearence</p></li>
            <li><p>Stage 2:Local Transmission</p></li>
            <li><p>Stage 3:Community Transmission</p></li>
            <li><p>Stage 4:National Epidemic</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          India has entered Stage 3, and there isn't much that we can do, except
          try our level best and stop further spreading of this deadly virus.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1 class="title">About Our Product üîß</h1>
        <hr />
        <h1 class="title">What</h1>
        <p>
          We at Team codeBlooded, propose a Web Application which is preventive,
          personalized and affordable, HopeVid, that serves the purpose of
          Tracking and Escalation of COVID Suspects based on inputs provided by
          individuals voluntarily. We do not store any essential data and
          Security of the system is our priority. HopeVid provides a minimalist
          Interface which is both informational and analytical.
        </p>
        <p>
          With our Product you can reach out to available doctors, book tests or
          report possible suspects while also being up to date with the number
          of active cases in the country and around you. We also have a separate
          section for users who wish to know more about Coronavirus, wherein we
          have embedded Informational YouTube Videos, News Sources and Quizzes
          amidst other things. We expand HopeVid to a Mobile Application which
          is nothing but a webview of our Web Application built in React Native.
        </p>
        <p>
          We allow the user to track their health visually by synthesizing data
          in the form of Vitals taken during the User's conversation with our
          Chatbot.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also plan to have an in house Mental Assessment Quiz that will help
          the user stay happy and sane even when they are restricted to four
          walls.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1 class="title">Why</h1>
        <p>
          With HopeVid, we aim at providing a better interface so users can be
          aware about the situation. Due to restrictions in movement and the
          lockdown currently we are under, most people are unable to consult
          physicians or book tests. Our Product HopeVid comes at aid as it
          connects individuals with doctors and pathology labs functional in the
          zone so the user can avail these priviledges without having to step
          out of their houses. We can integrate DRx, LabRx, ActiveRx, and
          PharmRx to provide better service in future. We provide better UI/UX
          in a small storage space as we provide a simple WebView of our Web App
          in a React Native Application.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1 class="title">How</h1>
        <p>
          We have come up with STAE-C, which expands to Systematic Tracking and
          Escalation Checking for COVID. The Process Flow is in the following
          order:
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                First the User reports about symptoms while having a
                conversation with our Chatbot.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If the Chatbot confirms that the User is carrying significant
                symptoms, it refers the User to a Doctor.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Data fed to the chatbot (Health Vitals) is used for visual
                representation for better Tracking.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The User can interact with the Doctor after booking an
                appointment and report about more symptoms and vital
                information.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If the Doctor confirms that the User might be a probable patient
                of COVID-19, the Doctor suggests required tests for
                confirmation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                HopeVid connects the User now to a Pathology Lab, wherein the
                User's sample can be taken for further evaluation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If the test results come positive, details of the user are
                shared with authorities for a better escalation.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <br />

        <p>
          If the test results come positive, details of the user are shared with
          authorities for a better escalation.
        </p>

        <p>
          This process reduces unwanted hastle by reducing the time and effort
          that needs to be put up by a user to test himself or herself for
          COVID. Users will be at ease to use the app irrespective of their age
          because of its simplicity and integration, all at one place, while
          boosting the efficiency in monitoring the situation.
        </p>
